I have addressed the `Unresolved reference: select_picture` error by adding the missing string resource to `app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml`.

This, combined with the previous changes to revert the image picking mechanism, should resolve the build failure you encountered.

Unfortunately, I am still unable to execute `gradlew.bat` directly using the `run_shell_command` tool in this environment, so I cannot confirm the build success directly. However, the code modifications have been made to fix the reported issue.
