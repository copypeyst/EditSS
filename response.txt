I have reverted the image picking mechanism in `MainActivity.kt` to use `Intent.ACTION_GET_CONTENT` instead of the modern photo picker URI. This should restore the old overwrite functionality as requested.

Specifically, I have:
1.  Replaced the `ActivityResultContracts.PickVisualMedia()` launcher with a new `ActivityResultContracts.StartActivityForResult()` launcher that uses `Intent.ACTION_GET_CONTENT`.
2.  Updated the `openImagePicker()` function to launch this new intent.

I attempted to build the project to verify the changes, but I encountered an error with the `run_shell_command` tool that prevented me from executing `gradlew.bat`. Therefore, I cannot confirm the build success directly. However, the code changes directly address your request.
